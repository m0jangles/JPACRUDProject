# JPACRUDProject

# About: This project is one of my first attemps at putting all of the pieces together for a simple front-end to back-end application.
I enjoyed this project very much and wanted it to be something that I would personally use for my Pokemon collection hobby.

Collecting Pokemon cards is a bit of nostalgic hobby since collecting my first cards in middle-school and now revisiting with 
some of the newer sets.

# How To
The app is intended to keep track of a user's personal collection of Pokemon cards.  I started off by loading the Base Set from 1999.
I would like to expand the collection to include more sets.  The most important parts to update for a collecter would be: status,
set, and notes.  In the status, the collecter might enter something like "have" or "need" depending on whether they have or
need the card for their collection.  In set, the collector will enter the Pokemon card set that the card belongs to, such as: Base,
Jungle, Team Rocket, etc.  In the notes, the collector could enter additional notes such as the quantity of a particular card, or the
condition, so that they could reference their personal inventory for trading.  All fields can be updated which means the user could
add all of the cards in their collection and keep track of which ones they still need.
